// The default WhyUs / Guarantee / TrustBar blocks were byte-identical on all
// 13 service pages. ServicePage.jsx now picks an angle per service group;
// every other page keeps the defaults (zero visual change outside services).
// RULE: only restate site-attested claims (prices, 24-hr re-clean, ₹10k
// damage cover, pay-after, same-day-before-noon, NDA/GST/photo-logs for office).
